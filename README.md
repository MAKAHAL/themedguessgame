Guess the Number

Overview

In this assignment, you'll create one of two possible computer games: Themed Guess or Number Guess. These apps will run in the browser, and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code.

Commits

Having an active and healthy commit history on GitHub is important for your future job search. It is also extremely important for making sure your work is saved in your repository. If something breaks, committing often ensures you are able to go back to a working version of your code.

Committing often is a signal to employers that you are actively working on your code and learning.

We use the mantra “commit early and often.” This means that when you write code that works, add it and commit it!

Numerous commits allow you to see how your app is progressing and give you a point to revert to if anything goes wrong.

Be clear and descriptive in your commit messaging.

When writing a commit message, avoid vague messages like "fixed." Be descriptive so that you and anyone else looking at your repository knows what happened with each commit.
We would like you to have well over 200 commits by graduation, so commit early and often!

Submission on BCS

Please submit both the deployed Github.io link to your homework AND the link to the Github Repository!
Before You Begin

Read through the entire instructions and view the project board located in the Class Repo

Create a new GitHub repo called number-guess-game.

Inside your local git repository, create an index.html.

While still in your local git repo, create a directory called assets.

cd your way into the assets folder, then make three additional folders: javascript, css and images.

In the javascript folder, make a file called game.js. Use the src attribute of the script tag to link to this file, rather than embedding the code directly in your HTML document.
In the css folder, make a file called style.css.
You can choose to use bootstrap, materialize, foundation, ui fabric or another css framework.
If you use a CSS framework, you do not need reset.css. Just include the framework from the CDN.
If you choose not to use a CSS framework, you must have a reset.css in the css folder.
In the images folder, save whatever images you plan on using.
├── assets
|  ├── css
|  |  └── style.css
|  ├── images
|  └── javascript
|     └── game.js
└── index.html
Push the above changes to GitHub.

Choose whichever game you'd like to build. Making the Number Guess Game game will prove less challenging than coding Word Guess. However, as the challenge of the Word Guess exercise provides a more comprehensive review of this unit's material, we suggest attempting that assignment first.

Note: There's no shame if you'd prefer submitting Number Guess—it's still a proper challenge.

Push your selected game to Github Pages.

Requirements

Brief

Create a game in which a player can guess a pre-determined, random number.
The app will pick a random number
easiest version is a single digit number
hard version is a multi-digit number
Be sure to provide instructions for how many digits a player is guessing
The player will enter a number upon being prompted
The player should have a limited number of guesses
If the number is not guessed in a certain number of terms, the player loses.
The game should auto-restart and a counter should increase when the player wins or loses.

A well-designed UI
WCAG 2.1 AA
Could have

Object Design Pattern for JavaScript EXTRA CHALLENGING
Organize your game code as an object, except for the key events to get the number guessed. This will be a challenge if you haven't coded with JavaScript before, but we encourage anyone already familiar with the language to try this out.
Save your whole game and its properties in an object.
Save any of your game's functions as methods, and call them underneath your object declaration using event listeners.
Style Rules

No var
Must have ; in the appropriate places
Variable names should be camelCase and thoughtfully named
Consistent usage of quoations or backticks
No unused variables
Indented and Appropriately Spaced
A Few Tips

IMPORTANT: Whichever assignment you choose, code your game one piece at a time! Code all of your apps one piece at a time. Always code one piece at a time!

Pseudocode your program and break the app down into tiny, manageable fragments. This will make the coding process much less frustrating and a veritable Mach number faster. Otherwise, you'll be chipping away at a giant chunk of abstraction for way too many hours.

The ability to solve a large problem by treating it as a set of smaller ones is the hallmark of a strong programmer. Best start adapting this into your development routine now, to better prepare for your more complex future projects.
Remember:
Split the whole program into many distinct, pseudocoded problems.
Focus on one of the smaller problems and solve it.
Only when you solve one problem should you then move onto your next problem.
When you encounter bugs (and we all do), console.log will become your best friend. Regularly check your console to make sure your app is spitting out the right values.

As a more advanced—but more powerful—alternative, feel free to experiment with the Chrome DevTools Debugger.
Try your best to deliver a 'working/playable game' by the end of the deadline. If you're not making progress with Word Guess, switch gears to the Psychic game. Contact your TA/Instructor if you're not making progress after 2 hours. We're here to help!

Substance over style! Submitting a working game matters more that making a broken app that at least looks pretty. We're focusing on game mechanics, not just on the look and feel of your app.

That said, coding a functional app that also looks pretty would be impressive.

Always commit your work and back it up with GitHub pushes. You don't want to lose hours of your work because you didn't push it to GitHub every half hour or so.

Commit often.
Turn in anything you have! Even if you don't finish, we still want to see what you were able to accomplish in the time we gave you. This will help us know what concepts we could help you with, as well as what topics we should focus on in the coming lectures.

Reminder: Submission on BCS

Please submit both the deployed Github.io link to your homework AND the link to the Github Repository!

Add To Your Portfolio

After completing the homework please add the piece to your portfolio. Make sure to add a link to your updated portfolio in the comments section of your homework so the TAs can easily ensure you completed this step when they are grading the assignment. To receive an 'A' on any assignment, you must link to it from your portfolio.

One More Thing

If you have any questions about this project or the material we have covered, please post them in the community channels in slack so that your fellow developers can help you! If you're still having trouble, you can come to office hours for assistance from your instructor and TAs.

Good Luck!
